Jill is John's aunt.
Jill is Mary's mother.
Anne is John's sister.
Jack is Mary's brother.
==================================
Anne is Jack's cousin.

# Here it is critical that we have the assumption that siblings
# share both parents.
# Without that assumption this inference is not valid, because
# Jack and Anne would not have to share parents who are siblings.
